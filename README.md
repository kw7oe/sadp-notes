An architectural pattern establishes a relationship between:

- **A context:** A recurring, common situation in the world that give rise to a problem.
- **A problem:** The problem, appropriately generalized, that arises in the given context.
- **A solution:** A successful architectural resolution to the problem, appropriately abstracted. The solution of a pattern is determined and described by:
  - A set of element types
  - A set of interaction mechanisms or connectors
  - A topological layout of the components
  - A set of semantic constraints covering topology, element behavior and interaction mechanisms

### List of architecture styles

- [MVC](architecture/mvc.md)
- [Publish/Subscribe](architecture/publish_subscribe.md)
- [Broker](architecture/broker.md)
- [Client-Server](architecture/client_server.md)
- [Service-Oriented Architecture](architecture/soa.md)
- [Peer to peer](architecture/p2p.md)

### List of tactics

1. Ping/Echo to detect faults. Common side effects are:
    - Security: How to prevent ping flood attack?
    - Performance: How to ensure the performance overhead of ping/echo is small?
    - Modifiability: How to add ping/echo to the existing architecture?
2. Increase available resources to help performance. Common side effects are:
    - Cost: Increased resources cost more
    - Performance: How to utilize the increase resources efficiently?
3. Scheduling Policy to address efficient use of resources. Common side effects are:
    - Modifiability:
      - How to add the scheduling policy to existing architecture?
  	- How to change the scheduling policy in the future?
4. Use an intermediary to address the addition of the scheduler. Common side effects are:
    - Modifiability: How to ensure all communication pass through the Intermediary?
5. Restrict Communication Paths to address the concern that all communication passes through the intermediary. Common side effects:
    - Performance: How to ensure the performance overhead of the intermediary are not exessive?
6. Maintain multiple copies to increase availability.



# Design Patterns

### Creational
- Abstract the instantiation process
- Help make a system independent of how its objects are created, composed and represented
- **Class patterns:** use inheritance to vary the class that's instantiated
- **Object patterns:** delegate instantiation to another object
- Two dominant ideas
  - encapsulating knowledge about which concrete classes the system uses.
  - hiding how instances of these concrete classes are created and combined
- Creatianol design patterns
  - Give flexibility in what gets created, how it get created and when

### Stuctural
- Concern with how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures
- **Class patterns:** use inheritance to compose interface or implementations.
  - This allows multiple inheritances to be mixed into one.
- **Object patterns:** describe ways to compose objects to realize new functionality
  - This give flexibility to change compositions and run-time.

### Behavioural
- Concern with alogiritms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
  - not just pattern of objects, but also patterns of communication between them
- Characterize complex control flow that's difficult to follow at run-time.
  - Shift our focus away from flow of control
  - Concentrate on the way objects are interconnected
- **Class patterns:** use inheritance to distribute behavior between classes.
- **Object patterns:** use object composition rather than inheritance.
